# Installation
### Step 1
Download the newest release of the **.rar file** for the resourcepack and unzip it in: `%appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks/`, so that your folder structure looks something like this:
`[...]/resourcepacks/StyxMineCMD/assets/[...]`

### Step 2
Open Minecraft and go to `Options... > Resource packs...`  and now make sure, the StyxCMD pack is at the top, like you can see in the picture:

Now, you can use the .bat file (with the same version as the rar file!). Have fun!
_Remember to press **F3+T** to apply changes to the game._
